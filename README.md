## Benchmark Suite for Heterogeneous Implementations of FFTs [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/60610005.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/60610005) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mpicbg-scicomp/gearshifft.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mpicbg-scicomp/gearshifft)

This is a simple and easy extensible benchmark system to answer the question, which FFT library performs best under which conditions.
Conditions are given by compute architecture, inplace or outplace as well as real or complex transforms, data precision, and so on.
This project is still in development.

If you want to just browse our results, see the [raw benchmark data](https://www.github.com/mpicbg-scicomp/gearshifft_results/) or our [online visualisation and comparison tool](https://www.kcod.de/gearshifft/).

`gearshifft` was published at [ISC2017](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-58667-0_11). The respective preprint is available on the [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.00629).

## Requirements

- cmake 3.7+
- C++14 capable compiler
- CUDA FFT library cuFFT 8.0+ or clFFT 2.12.0+ (OpenCL) or FFTW 3.3.4+
- Boost version 1.59+
  - should be compiled with same compiler version or ...
  - ... disable the C++11 ABI for GCC with the `-DGEARSHIFFT_CXX11_ABI=OFF` cmake option
- [half-code](http://half.sourceforge.net) by [Christian Rau](http://sourceforge.net/users/rauy) for float16 support (currently used for cufft half precision FFTs)

## Build

Go to the `gearshifft` directory (created by `git clone`):
```bash
mkdir release && cd release
cmake ..
make -j 4
```
CMake tries to find the libraries and enables the corresponding make targets.
After `make` is finished, you can run e.g. `./gearshifft/gearshifft_cufft`.

If the FFT library paths cannot be found, `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` has to be used, e.g.:

```bash
export CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=${HOME}/software/clFFT-cuda8.0-gcc5.4/:/opt/cuda:$CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
```

Enable float16 support for cuFFT:

```bash
cmake -DGEARSHIFFT_FLOAT16_SUPPORT=1 ..
make gearshifft_cufft # automatically downloads half library
```

### Build Dependencies

#### Automatically

gearshifft's dependencies can be build automatically by using the cmake's superbuild options.
Superbuild mode is currently OFF by default, so you have to enable it via cmake option `GEARSHIFFT_USE_SUPERBUILD=ON`.

An example for downloading and building Boost, clFFT and FFTW::
``` bash
cmake -DGEARSHIFFT_USE_SUPERBUILD=ON \
      -DGEARSHIFFT_SUPERBUILD_EXT_INBUILD=OFF \
      -DGEARSHIFFT_SUPERBUILD_EXT_DIR=$HOME/sources/deps \
      -DGEARSHIFFT_SUPERBUILD_EXT_DOWNLOAD_Boost=ON \
      -DGEARSHIFFT_SUPERBUILD_EXT_DOWNLOAD_CLFFT=ON \
      -DGEARSHIFFT_SUPERBUILD_EXT_DOWNLOAD_FFTW=ON \
      -DGEARSHIFFT_SUPERBUILD_EXT_DOWNLOAD_ROCFFT=OFF \
      -DGEARSHIFFT_USE_STATIC_LIBS=ON \
      ..

```

**Notes:**

- `GEARSHIFFT_SUPERBUILD_EXT_INBUILD=OFF` installs the dependency builts into a separate directory (`$GEARSHIFFT_SUPERBUILD_EXT_DIR`), otherwise builts are located in the binary directory (`$CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}`).
- If `GEARSHIFFT_USE_STATIC_LIBS=OFF` then you have to take care of environment setting such as `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`
- `GEARSHIFFT_USE_STATIC_LIBS=ON` probably requires to build Boost manually
  - To avoid clashes Boost's unit test suite main method is not build (see [Boost doc](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_65_0/libs/test/doc/html/boost_test/adv_scenarios/static_lib_customizations/entry_point.html))
  - Boost's utf main is added with `BOOST_TEST_DYN_LINK` definition (automatically done in our cmake)
- Use cmake option `GEARSHIFFT_VERBOSE=ON` to get more information during the cmake's build generation process

#### Manually

If the libraries have been build separately, just provide the correct path.
An example:

```bash
BOOST_VER=1.67.0
FFTW_VER=3.3.8
BOOST_ROOT=${HOME}/sw/boost-${BOOST_VER}
FFTW_ROOT=${HOME}/sw/fftw-${FFTW_VER}/

export CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=${BOOST_ROOT}/lib:${BOOST_ROOT}/include:${FFTW_ROOT}:${CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH}
if [ -d "CMakeFiles" ]; then
  make clean
  rm -rf CMakeFiles CMakeCache.txt cmake_install.cmake Makefile
fi
cmake ..
make
```

##### Build Boost from Source

Use cmake superbuild or follwing compile script.

<details>

```bash
## compile_boost.sh
# boost version to download
BOOST_VERSION=1.67.0
# where to download
BOOST_SRC="${HOME}/Downloads/boost"
# boost install dir
BOOST_ROOT="${HOME}/sw/boost-${BOOST_VERSION}"
# if install dir is empty, then download && build
if [[ -z "$(ls -A ${BOOST_ROOT})" ]]; then
  mkdir -p ${BOOST_SRC}
  wget http://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/boost/${BOOST_VERSION}/boost_${BOOST_VERSION//\./_}.tar.bz2 -nc -O "${BOOST_SRC}/../boost.tar.bz2"
  (cd ${BOOST_SRC}/../; tar jxf boost.tar.bz2 --strip-components=1 -C ${BOOST_SRC})
  (cd ${BOOST_SRC}; ./bootstrap.sh --with-libraries=program_options,filesystem,system,test)
  (cd ${BOOST_SRC}; ./b2 --prefix="$BOOST_ROOT" -d0 install --variant=release)
fi
```

</details>

##### Build FFTW from Source

Use cmake superbuild or follwing compile script.

<details>

```bash
## compile_fftw.sh
# fftw version to download
VERS=3.3.8
# we compile in separated directories, so binaries do not clash
VERS_single=${VERS}_single
VERS_double=${VERS}_double
# the install directory for fftw and fftwf
FFTW_ROOT=${HOME}/sw/fftw-${VERS}/
# "./compile_fftw.sh clean" removes directories
if [ "$1" == "clean" ]; then
  echo "clean sources"
  rm -rf fftw-${VERS_single} fftw-${VERS_double}
fi
# if directories do not exist, create them and unpack fftw_**.tar.gz
if [ ! -d "fftw-${VERS_single}" ] && [ ! -d "fftw-${VERS_double}" ]; then
  wget http://www.fftw.org/fftw-${VERS}.tar.gz
  mkdir fftw-${VERS_single}
  echo "unpacking"
  tar xfz fftw-${VERS}.tar.gz -C fftw-${VERS_single}
  cp -r fftw-${VERS_single} fftw-${VERS_double}
fi
IFLAG_STD="--enable-static=yes --enable-shared=yes --with-gnu-ld  --enable-silent-rules --with-pic"
IFLAGS="--prefix=${FFTW_ROOT} --enable-openmp --enable-sse2 -q $IFLAG_STD"
# float
cd fftw-${VERS_single}/fftw-${VERS}
./configure $IFLAGS "--enable-float"
make -j8
make install
# double
cd ../../fftw-${VERS_double}/fftw-${VERS}
./configure $IFLAGS
make -j8
make install
```

</details>


## Install

Set `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` as you wish, otherwise defaults are used.
```bash
mkdir release && cd release
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=${HOME}/gearshifft ..
make -j 4 install
```

## Superbuild and Packaging

Superbuild mode in cmake can be used to automatically download and compile the dependencies.
It is also intended for creating packages together with static linking of the dependencies.
It also supports multi-arch packaging of gearshifft targets, which have been compiled with different compiler.

```bash
cmake -DGEARSHIFFT_USE_SUPERBUILD=ON ..
make -j
make gearshifft-package
```

## Testing

The tests can be executed by `make test` after you have compiled the binaries.

```bash
cmake -DBUILD_TESTING=ON ..
make -j
cd gearshifft-build/ # because superbuild generates a build subfolder for gearshifft
make test
```

## Usage

See help message (pass `--help|-h`) for the command line options.
```
  -h [ --help ]                     Print help messages
  -e [ --extent ] arg               Specific extent (eg. 1024x1024) [>=1 nr. of
                                    args possible]
  -f [ --file ] arg                 File with extents (row-wise csv) [>=1 nr.
                                    of args possible]

  -d [ --device ] arg (=gpu)        Compute device = (gpu|cpu|acc|<ID>). If
                                    device is not supported by FFT lib, then it
                                    is ignored and default is used.
  -n [ --ndevices ] arg (=0)        Number of devices (0=all), if supported by
                                    FFT lib (e.g. clfft and fftw with n CPU
                                    threads).
  -l [ --list-devices ]             List of available compute devices with IDs,
                                    if supported.

  -r [ --run-benchmarks ] arg       Run specific benchmarks (wildcards
                                    possible, e.g. ClFFT/float/*/Inplace_Real)

... further backend specific options ...
```

### FFT Extents Presets

`gearshifft` comes with preset files which contain a broad range of FFT extents and are located in:

```bash
/gearshifft/share/gearshifft/*.conf

```

For FFTW benchmarks with, e.g., `FFTW_MEASURE` runtimes grow very quickly. You can delete or comment out the unwanted lines in the configuration file with `#`.
The extents configurations are loaded by the `gearshifft` command-line interface:

```bash
./gearshifft_fftw -f myextents.conf
```

### Examples

Runs complete benchmark for clFFT (also applies for cuFFT, FFTW, ..)
```bash
./gearshifft_clfft
# equals
./gearshifft_clfft -f myextents.conf -o result.csv -d gpu -n 0
```
List compute devices
```
./gearshifft_clfft -l
$ "ID",0:0,"ClFFT Informations","Device","Tesla K20Xm","Hardware","OpenCL 1.2 CUDA" <snip>
$ "ID",1:0,"ClFFT Informations","Device","Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2450 0 @ 2.10GHz" <snip>
```
Select compute devices by id returned by `--list-devices|-l`
```
./gearshifft_clfft -d 1:0
```
512x512-point FFT, single and double precision, all transforms, print result to console.
```
./gearshifft_clfft -e 512x512 -v
```
1048576-point FFT, only real outplace transform in single precision.
```
./gearshifft_clfft -e 1048576 -r */float/*/Outplace_Real
```
1024-point and 128x256x64-point FFTs, on CPU with 1 thread.
- If no device parameter is given, then ClFFT/OpenCL will use GPU, if available
```
./gearshifft_clfft -e 1024 128,256,64 -d cpu -n 1
```
1024x1024-point FFT, double precision inplace transforms.
- `--list-benchmarks|-b` gives a list of available extents read in `--file|-f` (default is ../config/extents.csv)
```
./gearshifft_clfft -r */double/1024x1024/Inplace_*
```

#### Hints for FFTW Usage

`gearshifft_fftw` offers some additional options, e.g., for the plan rigor or the time limit of plans, just check `./gearshifft_fftw -h`.
FFTW itself allows you to pregenerate FFT plans by the so-called wisdom files. These can be generated by FFTW tools, e.g.:
```bash
./fftw-3.3.5_single/tools/fftwf-wisdom -v -c -n -T 24 -o wisdomf  # single precision
./fftw-3.3.5_double/tools/fftw-wisdom  -v -c -n -T 24 -o wisdom   # double precision
```
It is recommended to compile double-precision (fftw-...) and single-precision (fftwf-...) to separate directories to avoid linker issues.
The wisdoms settings must match the `gearshifft_fftw` configuration (number of cores, precision, extents).
Most of the times you do not benefit from a multi-core setting, because the FFT is already computed almost in no time.
FFTW spends a lot of time in planning, except you use `FFTW_ESTIMATE` or time limits, which are also only lower borders.

## Measurement

The FFT scenario is a roundtrip FFT, i.e. forward and backward transformation.
The result is compared with the original input data and an error is shown, if there was a mismatch.
If a benchmark cannot be completed due to an error, it proceeds with the next benchmark.
The library dependent FFT steps are abstracted, where following steps are wrapped by timers.
- buffer allocation
- plan creation (forward/backward plan)
- memory transfers (up-/download)
- forward and backward transforms
- cleanup
- total time (allocation, planning, transfers, FFTs, cleanup)
- device initialization/teardown (only once per runtime)

Furthermore, the required buffer sizes to run the FFT are recorded.

## CSV Output

The results of the benchmark runs are stored into a comma-separated values file (.csv), after the last run has been completed.
To ease evaluation, the entries are sorted by columns
- FFT transform kind and precision
- dimkind (oddshape, powerof2, radix357)
 - oddshape: at least one extent is not a combination of a power of 2,3,5,7
 - powerof2: all extents are powers of 2
 - radix357: extents are combination of powers of 2,3,5,7 and not all are powers of 2
- extents and runs

See CSV header for column titles and meta-information (memory, number of runs, error-bound, hostname, timestamp, ...).

## Tested on ...

- linux (CentOS, RHEL, ArchLinux, Ubuntu, Fedora)
- gcc 5.3.0, gcc 6.2.0, gcc 7.1.1, gcc 8.1.1, clang 3.8 & 4.0.1 (FFTW threads disabled)
- CUDA 8.0.x, CUDA 9.x
- clFFT 2.12.0, 2.12.1, 2.12.2
- FFTW 3.3.4, 3.3.5, 3.3.6pl1, 3.3.8
- OpenCL 1.2 (Nvidia, AMD, Intel)
- Nvidia Pascal V100, P100, Kepler K80, K20Xm, GTX1080, Broadwell, Haswell and Sandybridge Xeon CPUs

## Issues

- clFFT does not support arbitrary transform sizes. The benchmark renders such tests as failed.
- clFFT on CPU cannot transform the 4096-FFT and 4096x4096-FFTs (see [this issue](https://github.com/clMathLibraries/clFFT/issues/171))
- clFFT seems to have lower transform size limits on CPU than on GPU (a complex 16384x16384 segfaults on clfft CPU, while it works on GPU). gearshifft marks these cases as "Unsupported lengths" and skips them.
- rocFFT is currently only supported on the HCC platform (no support for rocFFT->cuFFT path)
- At the moment this is for single-GPUs, batches are not considered
- if `gearshifft` is killed before, no output is created, which might be an issue on a job scheduler system like slurm (exceeding memory assignment, out-of-memory killings)
- in case the Boost version (e.g. 1.62.0) you have is more recent than your `cmake` (say 2.8.12.2), use `cmake -DBoost_ADDITIONAL_VERSIONS=1.62.0 -DBOOST_ROOT=/path/to/boost/1.62.0 <more flags>`
- Windows or MacOS is not supported yet, feel free to add a pull-request
- cufft float16 transforms overflow at >=1048576 elements
